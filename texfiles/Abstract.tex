\section*{Abstract of thesis submitted for the degree of \mbox{Doctor of Philosophy}} 

This thesis is concerned with investigating and proposing robust components for quantum information processing systems. We examine three different areas covering techniques for spin measurement, photon preparation and error correction.

The first research chapter presents a robust spin-measurement procedure, using an amplification approach: the state of the spin is propagated over a two-dimensional array to a point where it can be measured using standard macroscopic state measurement techniques. The work is an example of how simple propagation rules can lead to predictable macroscopic behaviour and the techniques should be applicable in other state propagation schemes. 

In the next chapter, we evaluate a quantum dot single photon source system, suggesting strategies to overcome decoherence from phonon interactions. We introduce a master equation technique for quantum jump situations that should have wide application in other situations.

The final chapter focusses on toric error correcting codes. We investigate the power of small scale toric codes and determine the minimum size of code necessary for a first experimental demonstration of toric coding power.
