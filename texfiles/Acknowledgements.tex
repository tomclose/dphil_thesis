\chapter*{Acknowledgements} 

I would first and foremost like to thank my supervisors, Simon Benjamin and Brendon Lovett. I could not have asked for better supervision or support over the course of my DPhil. I am also incredibly fortunate to have had the input of Erik Gauger, who has in many ways acted as a third supervisor. I thank him for his innumerable valuable contributions. I would also like to thank Kieran Higgins and George Knee both for the part they play in making the office a place I will miss, and also for their assistance with proof-reading chapters of this thesis. For the latter I would also like to thank Victoria Hore.

For financial support, I would like to thank the EPSRC and Oriel College. Furthermore, I would like to thank the CQT at the National University of Singapore for their hospitality.

I would finally like to thank my family and many long-suffering friends - especially Graeme Spence, Peter Inglesby and Richard Wood - who have supported me through the mostly-enjoyable-yet-occasionally-harrowing experience that is undertaking a DPhil.
