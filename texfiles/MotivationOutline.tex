We start this thesis with a general introduction

We proceed by  in Chapter \ref{ch:SpinAmplification}. 

In Chapter \ref{ch:SpinAmplification}, we provide 

Chapter \ref{ch:SpinAmplification} is concerned with 

Chapter \ref{ch:SpinAmplification} presents 

Finally, in Chapter \ref{ch:SpinAmplification} 

As the research chapters address a rather broad range of different questions in different physical systems, they will each have their own conclusion section in which we summarise key results of the study and discuss interesting remaining questions and avenues for further work.
