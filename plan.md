# Thesis Plan

## Quantum Information Processing
* QC History and implications
* A bit on quantum communication
* Measurement based
  * Compared with the circuit model
  * Equivalence to circuit based
  * Advantages: local ops easier, two disntinct phases
  * Generating remote entanglement - Barrat & Kok type + entanglement distillation
* Candidate systems

## Quantum Dynamics
* Schrodinger equation
  * Rabi oscillations (from Hamiltonian)
* Quantum treatment of light
  * Classical vs quantum
  * Types of light source & reduction to a single mode
  * HOM bunching 
* Light-matter
  * Jaynes-Cummings -> Rabi?
  * Raman procedure (classical light, 1st example of RWA)
  * Input-Output formalism??
* Open Quantum systems
  * Master Equation Derivation
  * Purcell-type argument
  * Deriving a coupling to phonons
  * Quantum jumps?

## Spin Amplification
Needs: Jaynes-Cummings?, Master Equations, Youngs lattice, Distributed QIP

Current structure:
* Readout problem and amplification solution
* Khitrin's 1D case - Hamiltonian, resonance
* Extending to 2D - derive rules
